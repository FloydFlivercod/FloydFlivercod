Floyd Flivercod's UNOFFICIAL custom AICP

Build using Linux - I Recommend Ubuntu!

Setup your build environment
Download the shell script "floydflivercod-aicp.sh"

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IkeGilbert/FloydFlivercod/master/floydflivercod-aicp.sh

Open a terminal & browse to where you saved the file 

Do the following:

  $ chmod +x flivercod-aicp.sh
  
  $ ./flivercod-aicp.sh

Sit back and let the script set everything up. This will download the source form AICP official servers and sync up
The final stage of the script will delete certain folders created in the sync & replace them with files from my github

When the script finishes:

$ lunch (choose device)

$ breakfast (example: bacon)
